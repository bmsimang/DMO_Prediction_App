# Zipcode Prediction Engine

We deployed our solution to a streamlit web application with a graphical user interface whereby the end user can input zip codes and get the likelyhood/probailility of it being either one of the three sale plays (single, double or tripple) using either one of our pretrained machine learning models, it also included a classification report for each individual model to illustrate how they performed.

The application also included an in-depth explanotory data analysis performed on the given homelink data set together with insights that were onbtained from the analysis.

However we stopped persuing the app implementation as we were advised that we would not be required handle the deployment phase of the project.

For a walkthrough guide on the installation of the streamlit application please use the following github readme.md file. 


## Installation

Use the package manager [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) to install [streamlit](https://docs.streamlit.io/en/stable/troubleshooting/clean-install.html) on the host machine.

```bash
pip install streamlit
```

After installation cd into the project and run the following execution command:

```bash
cd DMO_Predictio_App
```
Then..

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

The app should be serving at localhost after the above command successfully executes:

```bash
 Local URL: http://localhost:8501
```
